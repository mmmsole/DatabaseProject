We provided one single ".py" file, namely "app.py", containing the code to create the tables, populate them and run the queries.
The application is designed to run on both any IDE you may decide to use, and directly on the terminal. Let's see how to handle the app 
in both cases.

### USING THE TERMINAL
1)
- Open a terminal (cmd, Powershell, etc.);
- if not already done, install the libraries we used in the application (MYSQL.CONNECTOR, Pandas, tabulate);
- cd to the directory where you saved the folder;
- run "py app.py"/"python app.py".

2)
Then, you will be required to insert your name and the password through which you get connected to MySQL.
Once done, you will finally access the menu, which will allow you to load the dataset and creat the database, create the tables,
insert values in the tables, and run the queries. Notice that by selecting option 4 3 (insert values in the tables), some minutes may be required,
of course depending on the machine you are using. 
Then, by selecting option 4 (run queries), you will access a sub-menu showing all the available queries we proposed. It will be enough to type the
number of the desired query. Then, once obtained the output, you will end up again on the submenu. Notice that it is possible at any moment to exit
the application by typing 0 (to come back to menu) and then 5 (quit).

### USING AN IDE
3)
Import the folder in any IDE you may decide to use. Open the application ("app.py") and run it by clicking the "run" button. 

4)
Once done, follow the steps at point "2)".

This should be enough. Should you have any issues, just contact us and we will do our best to fix them.
